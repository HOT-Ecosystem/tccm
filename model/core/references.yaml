description: |-
  his diagram identifies all of the value domains that are used within the TCCM service itself. Each reference has a
  domain, which frequently isnâ€™t necessary to carry through to PSMs with strong type systems, a name that serves as a
  unique permissible value within the context of the domain, a uri that references the intended meaning of name, and an
  optional href that, if present, provides a link to a TCCM EntityDescription that provides definitions, descriptions,
  etc. of the meaning.

  The NameAndMeaningReference pattern represents, at the meta-level, one of the key purposes for a TCCM based service
  to establish lists of value domains (identified here by ReferenceType) from which sets of permissible values and
  meanings can be drawn.

  For each specific reference below we attempt to identify an ontology or value set from which the set of possible
  values could be drawn. We then state whether this set is mandatory, meaning that it must be used in a compliant
  TCCM implementation, recommended, meaning that, while not required, we anticipate that significant gains in
  interoperability would result were it used, or simply exemplar, meaning that the set carries examples of what
  might be used.

classes:
  NameAndMeaningReference:
    description: |-
      A NameAndMeaningReference consists of a local identifier that references a unique meaning within the context of
      a given domain in a TCCM service instance and a globally unique URI that identifies the intended meaning of the
      identifier.
    attributes:
      name:
        description: An identifier that uniquely names the reference within the context of the particular reference type.
        range: LocalIdentifier
        key: true
        required: true
      synopsis:
        description: A summary of the role and purpose of the actual reference
        range: string
      uri:
        range: PersistentURI
      href:
        range: LocalURI

  CodeSystemVersionReference:
    is_a: NameAndMeaningReference
    description: |-
      A reference to a specific version of code system and, if known, the code system which it is a version of.
    attributes:
      codeSystem:
        range: NameAndMeaningReference
        required: true

  MapVersionReference:
    is_a: NameAndMeaningReference
    description: |-
      A reference to a map version and the corresponding map, if known.
    attributes:
      map:
        range: NameAndMeaningReference

  PredicateReference:
    description: |-
      An EntityReference that serves the role of predicate. Note that this varies slightly from the base class of
      NameAndMeaningReference because the name attribute is a namespace/name combination rather than a simple name
      scoped exclusively by the domain.
    attributes:
      uri:
        description: TODO
        range: PersistentURI
        required: True
      name:
        range: LocalIdentifier
      href:
        description: TODO
        range: LocalURI
      designation:
        range: string

  SourceAndRoleReference:
    is_a: NameAndMeaningReference
    description: |-
      A reference to a source that also includes the role that the source played and/or fixes the particular chapter,
      page, or other element within the reference.
    attributes:
      role:
        range: NameAndMeaningReference
      bibliographicLink:
        range: OpaqueData
