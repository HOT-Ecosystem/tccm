#  This is a variant on the minimal valueset that includes all informational expansions
#  When formally expanding LOINC, we would have to decide how Long Common, Fully specified, Short and Display names
#   should be mapped to designation and description
#  This is a sample of a constructed SNOMED map.

value set resolution(valuesetdefinition, [using versions], expansion rules, return format) --> valuesetresolution

Philosophy for the openAPI spec:  Leverage http as much as posbile
Note, however, that we also need a python API
formats: YAML, JSON, CSV

expansion rules:
  count         - don't return anything, just the number of entities
  valid         - boolean
  expansion     - parameters are the possible expansion elements or "ALL"
  meessages/remove - remove errors
  simple list   - minimal
    codes:
        -  11111
        -  11113
