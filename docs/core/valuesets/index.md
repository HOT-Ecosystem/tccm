#### Defined

 * [ASSOCIATION](types/ASSOCIATION.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A formal “semantic” assertion about a named entity, in the form of subject, predicate, and object including any provenance, qualifiers, or internal BNODEs.
 * [BINDINGQUALIFIER](types/BINDINGQUALIFIER.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - An assertion about the semantics of a concept domain / value set binding. This model element exists specifically to address section 2.4.2.23 of the HL7 SFM14, which needs a qualifier that indicates whether the binding is “overall,” “minimal,” or “maximum.”
 * [CASESIGNIFICANCE](types/CASESIGNIFICANCE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - Identifies the significance of case in a term or designation.
 * [CODESYSTEM](types/CODESYSTEM.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A collection of metadata about the provenance, use, and distribution of a code system or ontology.
 * [CODESYSTEMCATEGORY](types/CODESYSTEMCATEGORY.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - The general category of a code system (flat list, subject heading system, taxonomy, thesaurus, classification, terminology, description logic ontology, first order predicate logic, etc.) (same as KnowledgeRepresentationParadigm: OMV 5.8).
 * [CODESYSTEMVERSION](types/CODESYSTEMVERSION.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A collection of metadata about content and distribution format of a particular version or release of a code system.
 * [CONCEPTDOMAIN](types/CONCEPTDOMAIN.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - The description of the conceptual domain of a field in a message, column in a database, field on a form, etc. Equivalent to the ISO 11179-3 “Data Element Concept.”
 * [CONTEXT](types/CONTEXT.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - External and environmental factors that serve to discriminate among multiple possible selections. While it is assumed that the specific contexts referenced by CONTEXT are represented by entity descriptions contained in some ontology or coding scheme, the CTS2 specification does not recommend any targets. Note, however, the TCCM context is intended to represent the notion of “jurisdictional domain” or “realm” as described in the HL7 CTS2 SFM .
 * [CURIE](types/CURIE.md)  (**Curie**) 
 * [DESIGNATIONFIDELITY](types/DESIGNATIONFIDELITY.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - Identifies how well a particular designation represents the intended meaning of the referenced entity. TCCM implementations may consider using the SKOS16 semantic relations to represent this relationship.
 * [DESIGNATIONTYPE](types/DESIGNATIONTYPE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - The particular form or type of a given designation: can be “short name,” “long name,” “abbreviation,” “eponym.”
 * [DateAndTime](types/DateAndTime.md)  (**XSDDateTime**)  - Represents an “Instant” as defined in the OWL Time Specification . Implementations must be able to support temporal units of second, minute, hour, day, month, and year, and be able to represent and compare instances represented in any of these units. DateAndTime can only provide a partial ordering and, as a consequence, i s never used as an index, unique identifier, or to sequence data or events.
 * [FORMALITYLEVEL](types/FORMALITYLEVEL.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - The level of formality of an ontology (OMV 5.9).
 * [FORMAT](types/FORMAT.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A particular way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file
 * [LANGUAGE](types/LANGUAGE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A spoken or written language intended for human consumption.
 * [LocalIdentifier](types/LocalIdentifier.md)  ([String](types/String.md))  - An identifier that uniquely references a class, individual, property, or other resource within the context of a specific TCCM service implementation. LocalIdentifier syntax must match the PNAME production as defined in the SPARQL Query Specification . LocalIdentifiers may begin with leading digits, where XML Local Identifiers and NameSpaceIdentifiers may not.
 * [MAP](types/MAP.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A set of rules that associate a set of entity references from one domain into those in another.
 * [MAPCORRELATION](types/MAPCORRELATION.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - An assertion about the strength or significance of a specific rule in a Map.
 * [MAPVERSION](types/MAPVERSION.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - The state of a Map at a given point in time.
 * [MATCHALGORITHM](types/MATCHALGORITHM.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A predicate that determines whether an entity resource qualities for membership in a set based on supplied matching criteria.
 * [MODELATTRIBUTE](types/MODELATTRIBUTE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - An attribute defined in CTS2 information model.
 * [NAMESPACE](types/NAMESPACE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A reference to a conceptual space that groups identifiers to avoid conflict with items that have the same name but different meanings.
 * [NamespaceIdentifier](types/NamespaceIdentifier.md)  (**NCName**)  - An identifier that uniquely references the scoping namespace of an Entity (class, role, or individual) within the context of a TCCM service. NameSpaceIdentifier syntax must match the PNAME NS production as defined in the SPARQL Query Specification - meaning that it must begin with an alphabetic character
 * [NaturalNumber](types/NaturalNumber.md)  (**int**)  - A non-negative integer (N). NatrualNumber is used exclusively for representing quantities.
 * [ONTOLOGYDOMAIN](types/ONTOLOGYDOMAIN.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - While the domain can refer to any topic ontology it is advised to use one of the established general purpose topic hierarchy like DMOZ or domain specific topic like ACM for the computer science domain. Only this way it can be ensured that meaningful information about the relation of the domains of two separate ontologies can be deduced (OMV 5.1 1)(sic).
 * [ONTOLOGYENGINEERINGMETHODOLOGY](types/ONTOLOGYENGINEERINGMETHODOLOGY.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - Information about the ontology engineering methodology (OMV 5.4) (sic).
 * [ONTOLOGYENGINEERINGTOOL](types/ONTOLOGYENGINEERINGTOOL.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A tool used to create the ontology (OMV 5.5).
 * [ONTOLOGYLANGUAGE](types/ONTOLOGYLANGUAGE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - Information about the language in which the ontology is implemented (OMV 5.7).
 * [ONTOLOGYSYNTAX](types/ONTOLOGYSYNTAX.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - Information about the syntax used by an ontology (OMV 5.6).
 * [ONTOLOGYTASK](types/ONTOLOGYTASK.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - Information about the task the ontology was intended to be used for (OMV 5.10).

 * [REASONINGALGORITHM](types/REASONINGALGORITHM.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A set of formal rules that allow the deduction of additional assertions from a supplied list of axioms.
 * [RESOURCETYPE](types/RESOURCETYPE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A class of which a referencing resource is an instance of.
 * [ROLE](types/ROLE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - A role that a SOURCE can play in the construction or dissemination of a terminological resource.
 * [SOURCE](types/SOURCE.md)  ([ValueSet](types/ValueSet.md))  - An individual, organization, or bibliographic reference.
